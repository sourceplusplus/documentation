# Tail Logs

The **Tail Logs** command allows you to view the logs generated by your application in real time. This command is useful
for debugging your application and determining what is happening at runtime.

## Available Contexts

The **Tail Logs** command has three different contexts:

- Statement
- Function
- Class

The context which the **Tail Logs** command is triggered determines which logs are displayed. If executed on a
statement, the command will display logs for that statement. The same is true for functions and classes.

## Parameters

- None
